This is a personal project inspired by the Freedoom project.

Freedoom Daemon Realm will be a free and libre 3D FPS game, with the gameplay of Freedoom plus some features present in
modern FPS Games.

I've decided to use Godot Engine to make this game

Planed enemies:
    All the enemies in Freedoom will be present, although with some changes, and a few new enemies of my own.

Planed weapons:
